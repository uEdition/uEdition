# User Guide

Welcome to the μEdition User Guide, which guides you, the editor, through the process of {doc}`creating a new μEdition <create>`,
{doc}`adding languages <language-add>` and {doc}`content <content>` to it, and {doc}`publishing it to GitHub Pages <publish>`.

The user guide tries to assume as little prior knowledge as possible, but you are expected to be able to navigate the
command-line. Additionally, for publishing via GitHub Pages, basic Git knowledge is also required.
