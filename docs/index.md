# μEdition

The process of creating and making available a (critical) digital edition often presents projects with a range of significant
hurdles, particularly around technical knowledge and hosting costs. The μEdition is a framwork that lowers these barriers by
providing a simple tool that supports users in easily building (multi-lingual) digital editions that can then easily be made
available online using free or low-cost hosting solutions.
