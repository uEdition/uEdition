# Updating the μEdition

The μEdition template is updated from time to time. In order to ensure that your μEdition is up-to-date with the latest
release, simply run

:::{code-block} console
$ hatch run update
:::

This will apply all the changes that were made to the template since you created the μEdition or since you last performed
an update.

It is recommended that you check the files that the update marks as "changed", before moving on with your work.
