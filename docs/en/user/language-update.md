# Updating a Language

The μEdition uses the same template approach for each language that you set up and these need to be updated separately
from the main update. Run the following command to update a single language:

:::{code-block} console
$ hatch run update-language PATH
:::

Replace `PATH` with the name of the folder of the language you wish to update.

As with updating the main μEdition, check all files, before continuing with your work.
