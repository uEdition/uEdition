# Creating a μEdition

With all the pre-requisites installed correctly, you are now ready to create your first μEdition. On the commandline
navigate to the folder where you want to create your μEdition and run:

:::{code-block} console
$ copier copy gh:uEdition/uEdition-project-template my-edition
:::

Replace `my-edition` with the name of the folder you want your edition to be created in. The setup process will ask
you a few questions about your new μEdition and create a skeleton μEdition in the folder you specified.

On the commandline, navigate into that new folder and all further commands are to be run inside that folder.
