# Getting started

Welcome to the "Getting started" Guide, which guides you, the editor, through the first steps of
{doc}`creating a new μEdition <create>`, {doc}`adding languages <language-add>` and {doc}`content <content>`
to it, and {doc}`publishing it<publish>`.

The guide tries to assume as little prior knowledge as possible, but you are expected to be able to navigate the
commandline.
