# Î¼Edition

The process of creating and making available a (critical) digital edition often presents projects with a range of significant
hurdles, particularly around technical knowledge and hosting costs. The Î¼Edition is a framwork that lowers these barriers by
providing a simple tool that supports users in easily building (multi-lingual) digital editions that can then easily be made
available online using free or low-cost hosting solutions.

adding documentation on how to do things, fixing broken things, or adding extra features, please let us know what is needed
and then we can make it better.
